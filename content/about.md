Welcome to the Super.NET blog.  Here you will find updates to thoughts and discussions around Super.NET.  Whereas the Super.NET site is meant more for establishing vision and explanatory purposes, this site is mostly for the information and/or thoughts that have occurred _after_ that site was created and published.

Additionally, this site serves as the archive for the posts formerly hosted on the Developers.win blog.  Please see this post for more details.
