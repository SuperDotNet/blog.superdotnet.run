Welcome to the Super.NET blog.  Here you will find updates to thoughts and discussions around [Super.NET](https://superdotnet.run).  

Whereas the primary [Super.NET site](https://superdotnet.run) is meant more for establishing vision and explanatory purposes, this site is mostly for the information and/or thoughts that have occurred _after_ that site was initially created and published.

Additionally, this site serves as the archive for the posts formerly hosted on the Developers.win blog.  Please see [this post for more details](/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/).
