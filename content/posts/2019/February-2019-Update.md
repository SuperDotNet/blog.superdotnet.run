Yeah yeah... I know [last time](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2019/01/january-2019-update/) that I said I wouldn't do these any more, but I wanted to "check-in" and let you know that I am still alive and still have my heart set on this project, even if it's already 3 months (!) behind schedule.

## The Good News

The good news is that even after all that time, I still have enough budget to work on this sucker full time for the foreseeable future.

## The Bad News

The bad news is that I am essentially living off capital without any generated revenues.

## The Better News

I have an idea. üòÅ  More below.

## What Got Done?

Nothing too amazing, but I do have my new station and work environment finally ready to go:

A little shout out to the overclock community for helping me out to get this sucker configured and finalized:

## Take a Vacation (and Get Inspired)

When I started this post (about two weeks ago), I was thinking of taking a vacation and have since done so.  The vacation ended up being rather unworthy and I actually cut it short, *but* it did lead to a massive inspiration/realization on my end towards a simple idea that could fund this project perpetually.

And when I say simple, I mean it.  In fact, it simply takes something I am already doing in my daily routine and puts a business model around it.

Hopefully, in another month it will be an update here about this new idea and how it will enable (and thereby establish) this project.

Let's see where this goes.
