Welcome to another -- and perhaps the last -- installment of the "monthly" status updates here on Super.NET.  [Last month](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/11/december-2018-update/), I declared I would update here on the first Friday of every month.  Let's check in to see how that's going...

![My Life Story](/images/regret.gif)

Yep.  Pretty much.  In addition to undertaking an [embarrassingly underestimated personal project](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/12/attend-your-debts-real-and-imagined/), my entire [development environment crashed in the process](https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?106640-SOS-CPU_LED-on-a-Rampage-IV-Extreme-Motherboard).  Literally.  Video processing killed my machine.

Then, from there, it was onto building a new machine.  Through snowstorms (delays in all parts to arrive), and then the fun part, [configuring it](https://www.overclock.net/forum/13-amd-general/1640919-new-dram-calculator-ryzena-1-4-1-overclocking-dram-am4-387.html).

All said and done, I am *finally* (FINALLY!) back at my development space (or "home" as I called it when I sat down this morning) and am finally ready to code after nearly 3-months of not doing what I am supposed to be doing.

So, I am batting a 0.000 here.  I don't really follow baseball (Go Tigers), but I know that's bad.

It's funny, as when all this chaos was happening, I kept thinking that I have this monthly update to provide, and I am going to have to say that I got nothing done for two months straight.

Adding to the pressure.

And stress.

So, I am not feeling too good about progress these days.  I am not so hot on giving updates as they appear to jinx me and my creative process.

I might invite those who are really, truly interested in what I am doing to simply [follow my GitHub and see what I am pushing over there](https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET).

So, until further notice (that is, when I really have something to provide), the monthly status reports are nixed.  

And, I am not even sure at this point if I will even undertake anything at that point as that is more time and energy spent on something that isn't [the one thing I am focused on doing](https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-guide-to-stoicism-for-creatives-entrepreneurs-and-freelancers-8ad3fb8dafc8).

As my life's mantra has been lately: **shut up and code**.

Time to start actually doing that.
