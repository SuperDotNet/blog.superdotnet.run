Greetings to the 20 hits-per-month that I get on this site, for whatever reason. ðŸ˜†

Riding on the [news of the previous update](https://blog.superdotnet.run/2019/07/july-2019-update-pivoting-onto-blazor/), I wanted to put some official finality on this project.  Today, I have [archived this project on GitHub](https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/issues/29).

All is not finished, however.  I have been streamlining and simplifying my efforts, and will be folding the code found in Super.NET back into its previous incarnation, [The DragonSpark Framework](https://github.com/DragonSpark/Framework).

You can read more about [this and the current state of my world here](https://blog.dragonspark.us/2019/11/november-2019-status-update/).

Cya there. âœŒ
