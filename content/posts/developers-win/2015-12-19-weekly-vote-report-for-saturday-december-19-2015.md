Well now, a little late this week due to some technical difficulties. Based on a tip from [Sir Eder][1], the reports now include another vote for [One .NET Framework][2], which would be necessary for a ubiquitous .NET client application model. Reading the request also mentions a lot of the goals of a ubiquitous model. Please visit and vote.

Additionally, the I&#8217;ve also added the closed vote for Silverlight 6 to the reports. Since it is closed, I have gone back and forth on this one, but I have ultimately decided to add this vote to show the depth and absolute historical demand for a ubiquitous .NET client application model from Microsoft developers. Additionally, my primary concern with adding this vote to the list has been stigma and perception of Silverlight as a whole, mostly from web developers. In the end, a ubiquitous .NET client application model is not something these web developers would use in any case, so this concern is ultimately misplaced.

Please continue to share and support these ideas. Thank you as always for your efforts!
