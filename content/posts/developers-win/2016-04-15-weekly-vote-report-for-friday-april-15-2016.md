Awwww jyea! Today marks the big 3-0-0-0 mark for the premiere featured vote here on Developers Win! The report below (generated earlier this morning) shows it at 2,999. However, [if you check it out now][1] it is over the 3k mark. I cannot express how awesome it is to see this milestone, and it is easily better than anything I personally imagined when I created the vote a little over six months ago. So great to see! As always, please continue to share this vote with all your friends and [continue the great discussions out there in the community][2]!
