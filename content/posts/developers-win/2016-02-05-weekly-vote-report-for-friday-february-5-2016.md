Two new votes have been added for this week: [Run Xaml / C# (like Silverlight) Applications Inside, without Plug-in][1] and [Negotiate with Other Major Browsers Manufacturers Over a Common IL][2]. In all, these votes bring us up to 1,000 votes away from 25,000 total votes asking for a ubiquitous .NET client application development model offering from Microsoft. As always, if you know of a vote that is not listed here, sound off in the Disqus comments below. Thank you all for your past and continued support!
