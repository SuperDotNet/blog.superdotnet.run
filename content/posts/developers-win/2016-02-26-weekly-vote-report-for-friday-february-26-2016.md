WOW!  What a REALLY BUSY and exciting week!  First, the premiere vote on which I founded this site, <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-2015/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo" target="_blank">Create a Ubiquitous .NET Client Application Development Model</a> passed WELL over 2,000 votes (2,161 at the time of this report, in fact!) and was [marked as Under Review by the Visual Studio team][1]!  And then a day later [Microsoft announced the acquisition of Xamarin][2].  I am still personally trying to process it all, but let&#8217;s just say that it feels like Microsoft is finally starting to turn things around and get their house in order once again.  We are all now really looking forward to <a href="http://build.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">//build</a> and <a href="https://evolve.xamarin.com/" target="_blank">Evolve</a> to see what announcements they have in store.

Finally, after much debate, I have decided to add <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-2015/suggestions/4233646-allow-net-games-on-xbox-one" target="_blank">Allow .NET games on Xbox One</a> to the list of Ubiquitous .NET votes that I track here.  Usually when I (or &#8220;we&#8221;) talk about an &#8220;application&#8221; model, we usually do not think games, but when you think about all the great models out there &#8212; _[WPF][3] in particular_ &#8212; they do indeed allow this component and _do it well_.  This is also part of the reason why these models get so much adoption and traction.

So, with all of that excitement out of the way, let&#8217;s see if I can contain myself and get you the list of votes for this week.
