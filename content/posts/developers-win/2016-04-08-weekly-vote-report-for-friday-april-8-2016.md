We are still clipping along at just over 100 votes for the past week towards <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo" target="_blank">the premiere vote featured here on Developers.win</a>.  I personally am amazed that this idea still continues to achieve such a great rate of success after six months of existence.  Please continue to share and let your friends know.  Also, please continue to voice your opinion in the comments of these votes because it is great to hear what others are thinking, and how well it is resonating out there.  At this point in the process with the ubiquitous .NET client model vote (after having been marked as Under Review), it is probably where the value lies between the product and its prospective users.

In any case, thank you all who have voted and continue to vote. Even when I do not take the time to voice my appreciation here in these weekly vote reports, please know that I do appreciate your time and energy towards changing the world for the better. Catch you out there on the voting boards!
