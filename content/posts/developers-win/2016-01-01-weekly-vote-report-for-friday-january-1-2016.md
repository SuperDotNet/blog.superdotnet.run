Happy New Year! We here at Developers Win wish you the best and most productive year yet in 2016. We start this year out with a new Weekly Report, delivered on time early Friday morning. This week we have added a new rocket vote this week to [Open Source Xaml][1]. Within one week it has managed to gain enough votes to eclipse our own [Xaml vote in the Windows UserVoice][2]. Please check each of these votes out and vote! Thanks to all who continue to support and have a great, happy, and safe new year.

(Note: Please help spread the word by Liking and/or Retweeting our [kind weekly check-in to the Windows Team, Visual Studio Team, and Mr. Nadella here][3].)
