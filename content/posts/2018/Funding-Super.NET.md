## Figuring out the Money Game

I've had this crazy idea of Super.NET now for about six weeks, I want to say.  Probably a little longer.  A lot has happened during this time.  I turned 42, I had a near-death (not really, but close enough) experience, which essentially got me to kick out my art and [write about it](http://www.ossem.com/stories/2018/grind/), and coinciding with all of this, exploring [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and putting together the Super.NET vision.

At one point, I did indeed put together a neat coinjar of sorts to accept donations towards the endeavor of building Super.NET.  I liked it, but it still didn't feel right.  Accepting money from others without anything in return is basically a form of going into debt.  To me, at least.  From my view, it is not operating from a position of strength, essentially.

Also, you sort of set yourself up to fail in such a scenario.  There's a certain quality about announcing something to the world (to other human beings) and while bold, I think if the announcement is too bold -- no matter its intentions -- *you risk inciting envy in others*, which to me [is a form of ill will](/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#even-when-you-re-right-you-can-be-wrong).

So, in short, by declaring intentions, you already set yourself up to fail.  [Agent Smith and the Dark Matter](/2018/06/who-is-agent-smith/) understand this dynamic.  It is part of the reason they are so gosh darn quiet all of the time, I would say.

## Hashing Out the Options

I will share the coinjar here not that I want to accept donations towards this goal (although I will not stop you and will honor you for life if you did), but to sort of demonstrate my line of reasoning of late.

<div> <a class="donate-with-crypto" href="https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/40266c65-e420-4740-9c52-ddd24cca633c"> <span>Donate to the Honor Jar</span> </a> <script src="https://commerce.coinbase.com/v1/checkout.js"></script></div><br />

You can see that it goes to [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)'s [new commerce system](https://commerce.coinbase.com) that they are building, which I feel is really neat, which is again the reason I share it here.  This all got me to explore a lot in the past few weeks especially and I wanted to get my thoughts out in the open here.

### Option #1: Donations

I have already summarized this.  I could accept donations, but this is a form of handout that I am not comfortable with doing.  Not only does it set you up to fail (in my opinion), but you really only get one of these.  I would rather do this if I had like no food in the fridge and electricity company is knocking on the door (or worse).

### Option #2: Donations in Exchange for Something at a Later Date

This is actually what I ended up doing with my "Honor Jar": donate and you get something of value that can be sold at a later date.  The problem is that this "something of value" is my art, and while I am [certainly in love with myself](http://www.ossem.com/about/#franklin-albert-jones), it's a bit pretentious to think that my art is worthy of something to essentially invest in for later value.

### Option #3: ICO

*Wandering into dangerous territory here*.  In studying cryptocurrency, ICOs are a rampant phenomenon right now.  In fact, if you wanted to, you could [spend 20 minutes and create one yourself](https://medium.com/bitfwd/how-to-do-an-ico-on-ethereum-in-less-than-20-minutes-a0062219374).  However, this again gets back to the aforementioned problems.  You not only attract a lot of attention to yourself, but you establish expectations, which as anyone who has experience with human beings can tell you, is a Bad Thingâ„¢.

Also, having been part of a startup as I mention in [Super.NET's introduction](https://superdotnet.run/#who-are-you), I have had enough of that "environment" to last me for a while, if not a lifetime.

I think it's clear in all my decisions here that striving for the least amount of responsibility is the best chance for success on any level.

### Option #4: Take Time to Study the Space

This is sort of where I am at now.  Even though I am essentially working off savings and full-time towards this endeavor, I am not strapped for cash at the moment.  I have about a year to put together a proof-of-concept that explores my ideas and gauge market traction.  Currently I am 

### Option #5: Create a Proof-of-Concept with Revenue Model

This option paired with the previous option shows promise.  What I like about this is that I show a working model that generates revenue without having to ask anyone for money.  However, the problem now is that I am essentially building two applications: Super.NET (the framework and foundation), and then the proof-of-concept which is the application that is build upon Super.NET.  Super.NET is easily a year or more endeavor by itself.  In fact I would say it is 2-3 years full time with a very small team.

### Option #6: Bite the Bullet and Create a JavaScript Application

It sucks to think about doing this.  This is actually a violation of my principles and is the reason why I am doing Super.NET after all.  But after thinking about this, this is truly the only way to get to what I want accomplished without asking for money from others.  Additionally, much like my foray with Hugo, there might be some elements in the world of JavaScript development that I might be able to pull back with me in my pursuit of Super.NET.

## Selecting the Path Forward

So what have I landed on?  Basically options 4-6 as listed above.

The point here is to build a proof-of-concept that simply demonstrates the business model I have in mind.  It will be ugly as sin but get the job done.  Ugly as sin to win, yo. 

> Ugly as sin to win.

Keep in mind that my roots are in JavaScript and HTML, so it's not a matter of skill, but desire (ðŸ˜‚).  The idea will be to get a proof-of-concept that shows the big ideas, on a site that basically is built from Visual Studio's React+Redux templates and nothing more.

From there, it's onto the proof-of-concept.  Once the proof-of-concept is done (in JavaScript/HTML5), and there is interest in the idea, the idea is to move towards a world where I can work on Super.NET full-time while building out the next version of this proof-of-concept application.

I'm thinking perhaps 3-4 months to build what I have in mind.  Let's see how I do. ðŸ˜‰
