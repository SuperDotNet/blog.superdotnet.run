    <p>You&#8217;ve probably noticed that the vote reports have stopped here on Developers.win. Â Unless of course you don&#8217;t care about them, then you haven&#8217;t noticed them at all. ðŸ™‚ Â These of course were a side project of mine based on the <a href="https://github.com/DevelopersWin/VoteReporter">Xaml-console based application</a> that ran on a weekly basis, tallying the latest vote totals from numerous Microsoft UserVoice forums.</p>

<p>What happened? Â Well, I had a massive environmental refresh here in my life &#8212; both digitally and organically. Â It all started with a weird anomaly that I encountered with a project I am working on, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/433">and some results that were just not expected or explained in Benchmark.NET</a>. Â This led to a full analysis on my environment, on which I realized it had essentially been the same machine and install of Windows for nearly 3 years (!). Â That is, I installed Windows 8.0, then upgraded to 8.1, then to Windows 10 where it was that day when I made the realization. Â Furthermore, the machine I use has been a hyper-v server, then condensed into a regular workstation, so all sorts of bizarre artifacts were hanging around.</p>

<p>But that was just the beginning. Â From there, it spiraled into my personal life, where I took a hefty inventory of all the things in my life, most notably the storage that was &#8220;just sitting there&#8221; drawing $100/mo from me. Â This fact paired with a neighborhood garage sale two weeks removed from the realization made for a good challenge to clear out the sucker and boil down to the essentials, which I did. Â I highly recommend this for everyone, as its therapeutic value is immeasurable.</p>

<p>So, essentially, I&#8217;ve been out of pocket for two months and have returned with a new environment and perspective of sorts. Â While the vote reports were nifty, I do not think much value was gained from them. Â Besides, all the important votes have been captured and accounted for now. Â The <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-ide/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo">Ubiquitous .NET Client Model</a>Â vote is #2 currently of all time open issues. Â Can&#8217;t complain about that at all. Â I don&#8217;t think any weekly nagging is going to help here, and might even have the opposite effect.</p>

<p>Now, back to the code&#8230;</p>
