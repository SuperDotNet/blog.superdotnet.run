      <description>Welcome to the Super.NET blog. Here you will find updates to thoughts and discussions around Super.NET.
Whereas the primary Super.NET site is meant more for establishing vision and explanatory purposes, this site is mostly for the information and/or thoughts that have occurred after that site was initially created and published.</description>

      <description>Finally, Some Progress: v0.0.1 Today I am pleased to announce that Super.NET v0.0.1 is completed.
While that might sound exciting, it actually means nothing. The v0.0.1 release is simply a foundational and framework release, intended to provide the core framework infrastructure to build components and supporting cast on top of it.</description>

      <description>OK! In my last update I mentioned how I was going to stop doing these. Guess that shows you to not pay attention to the things I say, huh. ðŸ˜†</description>

      <description>Last month I updated with an idea that I had and said I would update here when done.
Well not to be outdone by my own word &amp;ndash; or, rather, neurotic tendencies ðŸ˜… &amp;ndash; I am here with an update.</description>

      <description>Yeah yeah&amp;hellip; I know last time that I said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do these any more, but I wanted to &amp;ldquo;check-in&amp;rdquo; and let you know that I am still alive and still have my heart set on this project, even if it&amp;rsquo;s already 3 months (!</description>

      <description>Welcome to another &amp;ndash; and perhaps the last &amp;ndash; installment of the &amp;ldquo;monthly&amp;rdquo; status updates here on Super.NET. Last month, I declared I would update here on the first Friday of every month.</description>

      <description>What Now? So with the last update, I feel I didn&amp;rsquo;t get into enough detail on why I got nothing done, and feel a bit compelled to explore this a bit more.</description>

      <description>Figuring out the Money Game I&amp;rsquo;ve had this crazy idea of Super.NET now for about six weeks, I want to say. Probably a little longer. A lot has happened during this time.</description>

      <description>.NET is the Commodore 64 that didn&amp;rsquo;t die.
In my view, .NET is easily the greatest invention out of MSFT during it&amp;rsquo;s grand and enduring history. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for nearly 20 years and MSFT continues to put the brightest talent into its gears and has continued to consistently adapt and improve it over the years.</description>

      <description>This is an article on the topic of philosophy in software, business, and life.
In the philosophy that is described here, it proposes that software development is a craft, much like wood working, pottery, beer, or &amp;ndash; as this section later calls out &amp;ndash; jewelry.</description>

      <description>This is an article on the topic of philosophy in software, business, and life.
The Need for Inspiration In my estimation, the primary issue with our .NET client development ecosystem is that of inspiration.</description>

Quick Word on Value Judgments Before diving into the subject, I think it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to have a quick word on what might be perceived as value judgements within my communication.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Up with Philosophy in a Tech Blog, Dawg? Fair question. I myself do like to keep concerns separated, much like my software design. Perhaps my thoughts here are better expressed in a personal blog.</description>

      <guid>/2018/06/msft-vs-ms/</guid>
      <description>In all my writings, you will see me use &amp;ldquo;MSFT&amp;rdquo; in describing Microsoft, as opposed to the other variant of &amp;ldquo;MS.&amp;rdquo;
There are two reasons for this.
First, it serves as a gentle reminder that the work we&amp;rsquo;re all doing here is for a corporation, whose efforts go to feed their employees and their subsequent families.</description>

      <description>While running Developers Win! last year I&amp;rsquo;d like to say, I made contact with a developer in the comments of one of my posts that I would classify is part of the dark matter, and have assigned the name Agent Smith.</description>
