<p>I suppose we can call this the July and August update since it is so late in July.</p>

<h2 id="serializer">Serializer</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2019/06/june-2019-update/">Last I checked in</a>, I believe I was bragging over the work and direction of working on the <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/issues/15">serializer</a>.  While I have made some progress, my work has been sporadic and honestly missing some &ldquo;heart.&rdquo;  I am not sure entirely for my lack of enthusiasm towards the goal.  However, I have identified the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Part of the friction here is that most of the work that I have done is already sufficiently addressed in the <a href="https://github.com/wojtpl2/ExtendedXmlSerializer">ExtendedXmlSerializer</a>.</li>
<li>While ExtendedXmlSerializer is probably the most recent personal development success I have had, it isn&rsquo;t exactly &ldquo;wildly&rdquo; popular &ndash; with only 118 stars at the time of this writing.  Even at such a low level of interest, it still requires maintenance and time in fixing bugs and addressing issues.  Maybe not so much now as it ages and matures, but writing a whole new serializer from scratch will certainly have its own new issues and I am not sure that sounds exciting to produce and endure at this point.</li>
<li>The focus of a new serializer would be performance.  While this isn&rsquo;t the sole and premiere reason, there is a sense that while I attempt to develop it, I would be seeking to create the fastest-performing serializer of all.  In some since that is a valuable goal.  In another sense, however, it would be, to out-do a developer or team of developers in their own efforts.  I am not sure if this should be a guiding principle in development.</li>
</ol>

<p>All that said, I might revisit the new serializer at some other point.  For now, I am going to focus on work that I find more appealing, if but for the exclusive concern of morale and momentum.</p>

<h2 id="blazor-development">Blazor Development</h2>

<p>I am <em>so</em> very happy for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-3.0#server-side">Blazor and its server-side application mode</a>, which is what the original vision of this project encompassed.  Now, I do not have to develop it nor do I have to incur all the risk and bugs of doing so.</p>

<p>There are a few areas I would like to flesh out around this area, the first and primary of getting acquainted with Blazor and standing up my first application.  This is now what I will be focusing on accomplishing in lieu of serializer development.</p>

<h2 id="first-application">First Application</h2>

<p>So, what is the first application?  Well, as I believe I have mentioned in other posts on this blog, one of my first dreams in life was to be a comic book artist.  Last year, I put together <a href="https://ossem.com/">an art project</a> that revisited and unearthed that desire.</p>

<p>While I would not want to be <em>exactly</em> a comic book artist now, I first and foremost describe myself as an artist (or &ldquo;creative&rdquo;).  For my first Blazor application, I am thinking of taking my art project and turning it into a store, whereby I can sell such art in a peer-to-peer manner via cryptocurrency (<a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, to be exact).</p>

<p>For reference, the first version of my art project &ndash; as well as this blog that you are reading this on here &ndash; is done with the amazing <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.  I had considered progressing this art project with Hugo, but limitations prohibited some key functionality as Hugo is a static content generator and the functionality I envisioned required dynamic interaction and updating.</p>

<p>Now that Blazor is here, those limitations are lifted, and I am able to continue fleshing out this idea to see where it goes.</p>

<p>In doing such, I will be able to demonstrate capacity with Blazor, as well as provide a medium to continue developing my digital art (in penciling and perhaps even more).  And, since it is built as a store where I can sell items, I might make finally generate a revenue stream to boot.</p>

<p>At the very least, I will have made a site that demonstrates my capacity for software development and digital art, which might make a good item on my resume once I run out of money. ðŸ˜†</p>

<p>There is lots to appreciate about this direction, so we will see where it goes.</p>
