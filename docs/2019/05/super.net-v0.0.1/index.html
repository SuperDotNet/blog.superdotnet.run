<h3 id="finally-some-progress-v0-0-1">Finally, Some Progress: v0.0.1</h3>

<p>Today I am pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/releases/tag/v0.0.1">Super.NET v0.0.1 is completed</a>.</p>

<p>While that might sound exciting, it actually means nothing.  The v0.0.1 release is simply a foundational and framework release, intended to provide the core framework infrastructure to build components and supporting cast on top of it.</p>

<p>It stems from my previous work with its previous incarnation with the <a href="https://github.com/DragonSpark/Framework">DragonSpark Framework</a>, which was then taken in a pared down edition and utilized for <a href="https://github.com/wojtpl2/ExtendedXmlSerializer">ExtendedXmlSerializer</a>.</p>

<p>I have taken the results from those two projects and reconciled them in this v0.0.1 release.  This release is very basic and is not even offered as a nuget package &ndash; I am waiting until v0.0.2 to offer such extravagances.  If you are interested in seeing it in its raw form until that time, however, <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/releases/tag/v0.0.1">it is available here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-non-marketed-release">A Non-marketed Release</h3>

<p><em>Please note that I still have not marketed or promoted this project in any way</em>, except sharing it with close friends and family, as well as personally to those online that I feel would be interested (and sometimes they actually are ðŸ˜†).</p>

<p>I started this project <a href="https://superdotnet.run/">last year around this time</a>, but was then confronted with about six months&rsquo; worth of personal delays which I have <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/12/attend-your-debts-real-and-imagined/">chronicled on this blog</a>.  Since April, however, it&rsquo;s been smooth sailing and I have been able to meet project goals and personal deadlines.</p>

<p>As far as promoting this project, it will not start until after the next phase of this project is complete: <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/milestone/2">the serializer</a>.</p>

<h3 id="next-up-v0-0-2">Next Up: v0.0.2</h3>

<p>The next step is arguably the most important, and that is <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/milestone/2">the serializer</a>.  To me, any project that is centered around presentation is only as strong as its serializer.  The best example of this is Windows Presentation Foundation, which has the <em>best</em> serialization model developed thus far with its Xaml system.</p>

<p>Lest we forget that a serializer is essentially the interface that allows a human to describe components that are instantiated, processed, and further rendered by a computer.</p>

<p><em>In my view, this process is undervalued, overlooked, and for the most part entirely misunderstood in our current development culture and ecosystem.</em></p>

<p>Thus, I will be attempting to build what is essentially the engine for this project for this next release, while also attempting to provide a worthy example of what I feel a serializer should be for the .NET ecosystem.</p>

<p>I should say that while performance is a goal, it is not the priority.  It <em>should</em> be faster than legacy seralizers, but <em>probably</em> not as fast as the new magic arising from .NET 3.0 core (although I will leverage what I can from there).</p>

<p><em>The primary goal and focus is to create an extensible serializer that re-establishes the spirit of the WPF Xaml serializer model, done in today&rsquo;s terms.</em></p>

<h3 id="remaining-work">Remaining Work</h3>

<p>You can see the established milestones that I have defined here.  I am essentially ballparking each release in 9-month increments, which is probably more than enough time but probably not.  And yes, you can connect the dots &ndash; a nine-month release cadence makes these my babies.  ðŸ˜…</p>

<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/milestone/2"><strong>v0.0.2</strong></a>] 2020-04-07: The Serializer</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/milestone/3"><strong>v0.0.3</strong></a>] 2020-12-08: Client Presentation API</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET/milestone/4"><strong>v0.0.4</strong></a>] 2021-12-21: Sample Hello Application</li>
</ul>

<p>(And yes, it is no coincidence that v0.0.4 is slated for the same date as <a href="https://windowsreport.com/microsoft-silverlight/">Silverlight&rsquo;s end-of-support</a>.)</p>

<p>For the hello world application, I have a neat idea for a cryptocurrency-based dApp (decentralized application).  Although, I am not entirely sure how decentralized it should be (as you will find if you study decentralized theory, there are many shades of this definition).</p>

<p>(Part of the advantage/design of the long development times is to give me the opportunity to continue studying and analyzing the space for best approaches towards a viable solution.)</p>

<p>However, it should be simple, and at the very least show off all the core features and vision of what I am building here.</p>

<p>And at a worst case scenario, I will have built myself some resume material as I should be broke as a joke by then, ready for a new job. ðŸ˜‚</p>

<p>On that note, back to work.  Please take a second and <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET">star me on GitHub</a>. ðŸŽ‰</p>
