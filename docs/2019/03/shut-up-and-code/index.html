<p><a href="/2019/02/february-march-2019-update/">Last month</a> I updated with an idea that I had and said I would update here when done.</p>

<p>Well not to be outdone by my own word &ndash; or, rather, <em>neurotic tendencies</em> ðŸ˜… &ndash; I am here with an update.</p>

<p>To start, I guess I am inspired a bit with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/37-Days-Launch-Ryan-Duques/dp/142765137X">37 Days to Launch</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great book.  Very inspiring and &ldquo;agile&rdquo; in its truest sense.  When you are after something to see if it works, you pretty much get to done as fast as possible and iterate on the failure &ndash; and failure is assumed.</p>

<p>In 37 Days, the purpose is to get something to market as soon as possible and gauge market feedback.</p>

<p>In my case here, however, it was meant to &ldquo;get it out there&rdquo; to see how it compared to how I envisioned it in the first place, and &ndash; more importantly &ndash; how I <em>feel</em> about it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-idea">What is The Idea?</h2>

<p>Well, the idea originated from an activity that I am already doing in my daily routine: finding interesting news and sharing links on social media.</p>

<p>Simple enough.</p>

<p>I also had recently read this really great blog that describes <a href="https://www.rankxl.com/">building passive income through website content</a>.</p>

<p>So, I was inspired.  My thought was to build a site around that and put banner ads around the content I am already sharing.</p>

<h2 id="what-actually-happened">What Actually Happened</h2>

<p>What actually happened was I built a satire site.  It has all the fixings to put in banner ads, and rough draft content is already there.  You can see it here:</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.cherrytree.today/">The Cherry Tree</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-feel-about-it">How Do I Feel About It?</h2>

<p>Well, in a word, <em>conflicted</em>.</p>

<p>First, I was able to bolt this baby together in two weeks.  Which is tremendously great and gratifying when you consider my timescale here with Super.NET (which I consider my &ldquo;<a href="https://medium.com/@dsilvestre/deep-work-heres-how-2c1fb0b4111">deep work</a>&rdquo; project) to be in years.</p>

<p>It was rather cathartic to be able to follow the vein of 37 Days and pump that out quickly (although this it would not be entirely possible if it weren&rsquo;t for the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">amazing Hugo</a>.)</p>

<p>However, after actually completing it and putting in place, I have reservations.  I am going to break this all down in a list I have been keeping.</p>

<h2 id="pros-cons">Pros / Cons</h2>

<p>Here is what I like about what I have done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very simple idea, built in 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Can generate passive income which will help to perpetually support Super.NET development.

<ul>
<li>Really the only way of providing revenue towards this project that I am comfortable with doing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Creative outlet.  Gets my ideas out there.</li>
<li>Helps build a brand and audience.  Useful for announcing new products or direction.</li>
<li>Try out the latest in blogging software (such as Hugo) and see how everything works.  This is relevant to Super.NET as I envision it making improvements in this area for .NET developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my reservations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not entirely necessary</strong>.  I have enough funding to last two more years of development.  Part of me is horrified and disappointed that I even considered doing this.</li>
<li>Gets my ideas there.  If you are astute, you noticed that I also already listed this as a pro/plus/benefit.  However, consider that this increases my online footprint, and I like keeping a low profile and flying under the radar.</li>
<li>Possible distraction.  I spend more time on building this site than this project.</li>
<li>Helps feed the Google AdSense machine.  I am actually impressed with AdSense, and think it&rsquo;s amazing, but at the end of the day, it does collect information on people and I am not entirely comfortable with that (although I could work with it if I could &ndash; see: <em>conflicted</em>).</li>
<li>The core idea is to clown on people.  Satire is a great form of feedback, but at the end of the day, I am clowning on people.  Although this is an improvement from straight-up trolling on people directly, it&rsquo;s something that I would like to eliminate &ndash; or at the very least reduce.

<ul>
<li>To further add to this, clowning on people is a form of coercion and manipulation, which I feel is root of all human societal ills.  The irony, of course, is that most of my content is clowning on people who do manipulate and coerce.</li>
<li>All that said, I feel the spirit in which this is done is healthy and not vindictive and/or angry, so perhaps it is not all that bad.  (Have I mentioned <em>conflicted</em>, yet?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So What Now?</h2>

<p>Well, I am not sold on this.  But it only took two weeks of my time to discover this.  Further, I might actually continue it.  To build up a site to make any meaningful passive income will take 6-9 months.  Is that possible in a side-project manner?  Do I have the patience to find out?  Do I have the stomach to face the risks?</p>

<p>I am apt to take all this whirlwind activity, cut my losses, and finally get to the main event.</p>

<h2 id="shut-up-and-code">Shut Up and Code</h2>

<p>As you may or may not know, I have been feeling compelled to write status updates here to keep people appraised of my efforts, even though I really do not have an audience nor have I put any effort into promoting my undertaking.  I have not promoted this project at all, and neither would I want to before it is actually completed.</p>

<p>The travesty is that nothing I have really done is actually towards this project in the past six months.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite laughable, honestly.</p>

<p>However, the good news is that nothing stands in my way from picking up where I left off six months ago (and I have actually already done that and have a couple of local commits established already).</p>

<p>My feeling as of late is to <a href="https://vitals.lifehacker.com/go-ahead-and-break-your-streak-1832526586">break that silly streak</a> of monthly status reports, remove all distractions, and exclusively work on my vision here with Super.NET.  I have plenty of runway and <a href="https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/qvmdkw/your-brain-is-constantly-searching-for-problems-to-fix">any perceived concern about finances (or any other &ldquo;problem&rdquo;) is really just that</a>.</p>

<p>The expression of late in my mind has been &ldquo;<em>shut up and code</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may just become my mantra for life.</p>

<p>This means no social media, no side projects, no blogging (such as this) and focusing exclusively on this project.</p>

<p>So, that is where I am at with all of this.  I do not know the next time I will post on this blog.  Honestly, the longer time it is, the better.  All of these words and the effort it takes to amass them is an undertaking and a distraction in the end.  That is my current feeling about things, at the least.</p>

<p>With all of that said, wish me luck.  And if interested, please <a href="https://github.com/SuperDotNet/Super.NET">follow my efforts on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>See you there. âœŒ</p>
