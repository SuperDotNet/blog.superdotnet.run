<p>Welcome to the Super.NET Blog, Dawg!  Here, you will find supplemental resources for the <a href="https://superdotnet.run/">Super.NET</a> main site, as well as the archive for the now-retired &ldquo;Developers.win!&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="built-with-hugo">Built with Hugo</h4>

<p>I have been spending some time with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> in designing this site, and I have been nothing short of being completely and utterly impressed.  Both this site and the Super.NET site have been created in Hugo, and the blog I am now typing this out in <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a>, which is incredible in its own right.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Dawg.jpg" alt="Dawg" /></p>

<p>If you have a blog or are a student of design, do yourself a favor and check out the paradigm that Hugo and company offer.  If you have not been caught up with the current minimal and simplicity approach to software design, you will be once you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">groked</a> Hugo.</p>

<p>And no, I have not swung over into the land of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, but I am certainly a fan, and hope to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard#Mimetic_desire">incorporate some of its elegant magic</a> into my efforts with Super.NET.</p>

<h4 id="learn">Browse Developers Win! Archive</h4>

<p>Before I get into the why and how, if you would like to browse the old archive of Developers Win! postings, you can <a href="/categories/developers-win/">do that here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="so-the-developers-won">So, The Developers&hellip; won?</h4>

<p>In October 2015, I created an experimental site that aimed to bring to the attention of <a href="/2018/06/msft-vs-ms/">MSFT</a> several issues that I felt were important.  There were about a dozen votes in total.  <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-ide/suggestions/10027638-create-a-ubiquitous-net-client-application-develo">Only one gained significant traction</a> and that is now the focus of my efforts here in Super.NET.  You can read more about those efforts <a href="https://superdotnet.run">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do one thing and do that one thing really really really well.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="http://www.kevingliner.com/">Kevin Gliner</a>, former mentor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an effort to streamline my thought and work process, I have decided to shutter that experimental site and move its contents into this blog here.  I will still reference some of the old material found in those archives as they are still pertinent towards the overarching philosophy and drive here with our efforts in Super.NET.</p>

<h4 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h4>

<p>I am very grateful for having done the Developers Win! experiment.  In my time creating ideas and subsequently interacting with the community and its managers, I have learned a thing or two that I thought I would share here, in the spirit of a retrospective of sorts.</p>

<h4 id="the-world-doesn-t-revolve-around-me">The World Doesn&rsquo;t Revolve Around Me</h4>

<p>Contrary to popular belief &ndash; that being <em>my own</em> &ndash; the world doesn&rsquo;t revolve around me.  Setting up a wish doesn&rsquo;t make it a guarantee that it will happen.  In fact, if not worded properly, it can cause more grief than it&rsquo;s worth, or result in a completely different result and experience than I originally envisioned when I thought of the idea.  There are a <em>lot</em> of people out there, which reminds me&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="there-are-a-lot-of-human-beings-in-the-world">There Are a <em>Lot</em> of Human Beings in the World</h4>

<p>The problem space that we work in is <em>incredibly</em> complex and involved.  Human beings are multifaceted (or sometimes just downright crazy).  You have no idea what each person has to deal with in their daily grind, and the scope of their individual experience.  What I have learned is that each person has their own opinion and they are 100% as valuable as mine, even if that opinion does not make logical sense to me.  Which leads me to&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="even-when-you-re-right-you-can-be-wrong">Even When You&rsquo;re Right, You Can Be Wrong</h4>

<p>If you logically win an argument but have a condescending/disparaging/trolling attitude in doing so &ndash; <em>resulting in ill will towards the person you are interacting with</em> &ndash; then you have actually <em>lost</em> that argument, as that ill will impacts your brand value.  As such&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="brand">Mind Your Brand</h4>

<p>This is sort of the apex of value learned here in my experiment and adventure.  <em>Everything</em> you do reflects on you and your brand.  Are you the person that has to be <em>right all the time</em>?  Do you resort to trolling or other coercive tactics to will your &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; to your way?  Do you even see to the world as being branched into &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; and &ldquo;proponent?&rdquo;  Or do you see the world as fragmented, collective whole?  Perhaps somewhere in between?  Or maybe even something even more involved?</p>

<p>All of these aspects (and many many more) speak to your character and resulting brand as such.</p>

<p>Attempting to coerce another human being with aforementioned &ndash; or, really, <em>any</em> &ndash; tactics as above is not only ineffective, it&rsquo;s <em>childish</em>.  It&rsquo;s selfish and self-centered.  Yes, you might throw down some epic flame on a forum some where &ndash; and yes, in its own right it&rsquo;s extraordinary prose and you can pat yourself on the back &ndash; but in the end, you have attempted to dominate the indomitable, the fellow human spirit that runs as wild as you do.  You have not only fostered <em>ill will</em>, but now it will no doubt make its way back to you in some form.  As such, you should&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="choose-your-energy-carefully">Choose Your Energy Carefully</h4>

<p>I am of the mindset that any energy you send out into the world will make its way back to you <strong>in the form of its choosing</strong>, <em>plus interest</em>.</p>

<p>The key there being that it might not even &ldquo;return&rdquo; in the way that you expect it, and the energy of such returned that involves a factor of time, much like how interest accrues in your savings account.  I call it <strong>Karma+</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps a little woo-woo pseudoscience, but that is how I view the world based on my experience and yes (I am willing to admit), <em>biases</em>.  So, be careful of how you treat people and the energy you put out there.  Negative begets negative and positive begets positive &ndash; not only to the people you spill it to, but how it ultimately makes its way back to you.</p>

<h4 id="someone-can-be-completely-different-than-you-and-that-is-ok">Someone Can Be Completely Different Than You &hellip; <em>And That Is OK</em></h4>

<p>Again this comes back to brand.  <a href="https://youtu.be/Oo9buo9Mtos">What matters in life</a> is not how someone handles <em>their</em> business.  What matters is how you handle <em>yours</em>, and more specifically &ndash; how you <em>react</em> to someone who does not align with your expectations.  This brings me to the final lesson here&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="it-s-not-how-you-win-but-how-you-lose">It&rsquo;s Not How You Win, but How You Lose</h4>

<p>Finally, one of my high school principals (yeah, several, I was an army brat and moved a lot) told me once that our <em>attitudes determine our altitude</em>.  While I generally understood this concept, I see now that this is especially pertinent when things do <em>not</em> go your way, or do not go as expected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your attitude determines your altitude.</p>

<p>&ndash; Mike-EEE&rsquo;s High School Principal, Somewhere, Sometime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another way I like to say this now is: it&rsquo;s not how you win, but it&rsquo;s how you <em>lose</em>.  That is, any hack can win, and celebrate accordingly.  But the <em>true</em> winners are the ones that understand that loss <em>will</em> occur and, when it does, know how to hold themselves in such a situation.</p>

<h4 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h4>

<p>I would like to take this time to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintRutkas">Clint Rutkas</a> and the UWP team for their efforts on their UserVoice forum, resulting in shaping out what I can now say was a <em>gigantic</em> blind spot in my world, leading to a lot of personal growth and most of the aforementioned lessons.  Kudos to Clint especially for pointing out the value in <a href="#brand">personal brand</a>, particularly.  Consider that all of this was made possible because I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created Developers Win!</li>
<li><a href="https://wpdev.uservoice.com/">Created some votes</a></li>
<li>Met Clint and team to steer me in the right direction</li>
</ol>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t happen overnight, of course.  It&rsquo;s been about a 3-year process that involved my interactions not only on Windows Developer UserVoice, but elsewhere on the web.  I always try to be mindful of feedback and try to adjust accordingly.  As with software, some (personal) problems are more difficult than others and take a while to resolve.</p>

<p>Finally, Clint&rsquo;s Twitter bio mentions that he is &ldquo;helping developers&rdquo; but I am not sure if this help is intended to be the results provided here.  In any case, I accept it.  Cheers to you, Clint and Team.  I wish you best of success to your crew there as we head into the next  phase of MSFT&rsquo;s honorable history.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the lessons learned out of the way, it&rsquo;s worth noting that this blog will serve as the <a href="/categories/developers-win/">archive of previous articles of Developers.Win!</a> in addition to hosting the thoughts and highlights of my efforts taking place at Super.NET.</p>

<p>I would like to send a sincere shout of appreciation to all who have supported my ideas and subsequent energies over these past few years, and have voiced their encouragement in my efforts.  I hope to continue this further in my efforts with Super.NET and will see you out there in the field of play.  In the meantime, much respect and blessings to you!</p>
