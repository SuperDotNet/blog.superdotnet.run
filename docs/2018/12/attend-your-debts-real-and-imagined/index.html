<h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>

<p>So with the <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/11/december-2018-update/">last update</a>, I feel I didn&rsquo;t get into enough detail on why I got nothing done, and feel a bit compelled to explore this a bit more.</p>

<p>To start, I have been out of consumer financial debt since 2012, and out of professional debt since 2013 after paying off a loan for my business for general operations.</p>

<p>I am not a big fan of debt.  And yes, I am one of those who got swamped with credit card offers right out of college and maxed them all out, even going so far as taking over 120 days to make a payment (sort of testing the system of sorts?) and driving my score into the around in the high 400 area.</p>

<p>These days I am in the low 800 area.  It would be higher if I had a monthly payment (e.g. mortgage) that demonstrated ability to consistently and reliably make a monthly payment.</p>

<p>In other words, my credit score would be higher if <em>I assumed more debt</em>.</p>

<p><strong>This seems very broken to me</strong>.  Debt to me is a scourge, or maybe put another way <em>debt is dishonesty</em>.  It is a very dishonest way of operating your life and business.  But, that is just me and my opinion.  I know others are very high on debt and it is in fact how the banks <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">and governments</a> operate.  At the end of the day for me, though, when you assume debt, you are essentially cutting a corner, which, when you break it down, is a dishonest act to me.</p>

<p>Of course, some <em>temporary</em> debt is acceptable to me.  I would not go past a month in paying back, and that would be under extraordinary circumstances these days.  I do use credit cards for convenience and purchases, but I pay them off every Friday and keep all my financial planning and purchases &ldquo;ahead of me&rdquo; and essentially live off money that I have already earned and saved.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-point-here">What&rsquo;s the Point Here?</h2>

<p>The point here is that debt doesn&rsquo;t manifest itself in purely and strictly financial terms.  You can accrue debt in other ways, such as gaining weight and committing to projects with friends and family.</p>

<p>This is where I find myself now and why I have not accomplished much for Super.NET recently.</p>

<p>Providing some additional context here, I moved back from the Seattle area to my home state of Michigan in 2014 when my father had to have heart surgery (he&rsquo;s great now and our whole family is back together again).  However, there were a lot of personal and family projects that emerged from returning, mostly in the form of dealing with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that had been held by my parents or otherwise stored in my family&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>Last summer, I took the first swipe at accounting for this and helped clear out my family&rsquo;s basement which required a lot of bookkeeping (for lack of a better expression üòÅ).  We&rsquo;re talking two decades&rsquo; worth of history and more found in this effort.  It was incredibly grueling and I got most of it done, with the exception of the family media in the form of digitizing VHS tapes to make for some room.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20181122_110333.jpg" alt="Taking care of some family business" /></p>

<p>These past six weeks have been spent on attending to those video tapes as well as my own personal media found in MiniDVs, which ironically have been far more challenging and a pain to resolve.</p>

<p>Additionally, the family garage still needed some organizational love and that was left on the back burner for another time &ndash; which it turns out, is <em>now</em>. üòÖ  My intention was to wait until next March (&ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo;), but family members had another idea, so we started digging into the remaining work in October.</p>

<h2 id="the-point-please">The Point, Please???</h2>

<p><strong>The point</strong> is that these are the last remaining <em>identified</em> time sinks (or non-financial debt) in my life, and that is a big deal.</p>

<p>In planning for the future and for a project that will take two years of development, having these sorts of projects identified, known, and accounted for is a critical step to ensure success.</p>

<p>After all, this is all I am doing these next two years.  In a startup mindset, there is no &ldquo;personal time&rdquo; (I know this is very controversial in the interwebs, but that is my opinion on the matter), so the less distractions or non-financial debt that can interfere with my efforts, the better.</p>

<p>Sure, I could have chosen to continue to ignore these tasks and let them &ldquo;sit there,&rdquo; but that is something else that my mind would have to deal with subconsciously or otherwise.</p>

<p>And I can assure you that when you clear a debt, you clear your mind (and so much more, really).  That in itself is worth the effort being expended here.</p>
