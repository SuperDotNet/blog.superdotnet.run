<h2 id="figuring-out-the-money-game">Figuring out the Money Game</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this crazy idea of Super.NET now for about six weeks, I want to say.  Probably a little longer.  A lot has happened during this time.  I turned 42, I had a near-death (not really, but close enough) experience, which essentially got me to kick out my art and <a href="http://www.ossem.com/stories/2018/grind/">write about it</a>, and coinciding with all of this, exploring <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and putting together the Super.NET vision.</p>

<p>At one point, I did indeed put together a neat coinjar of sorts to accept donations towards the endeavor of building Super.NET.  I liked it, but it still didn&rsquo;t feel right.  Accepting money from others without anything in return is basically a form of going into debt.  To me, at least.  From my view, it is not operating from a position of strength, essentially.</p>

<p>Also, you sort of set yourself up to fail in such a scenario.  There&rsquo;s a certain quality about announcing something to the world (to other human beings) and while bold, I think if the announcement is too bold &ndash; no matter its intentions &ndash; <em>you risk inciting envy in others</em>, which to me <a href="/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#even-when-you-re-right-you-can-be-wrong">is a form of ill will</a>.</p>

<p>So, in short, by declaring intentions, you already set yourself up to fail.  <a href="/2018/06/who-is-agent-smith/">Agent Smith and the Dark Matter</a> understand this dynamic.  It is part of the reason they are so gosh darn quiet all of the time, I would say.</p>

<h2 id="hashing-out-the-options">Hashing Out the Options</h2>

<p>I will share the coinjar here not that I want to accept donations towards this goal (although I will not stop you and will honor you for life if you did), but to sort of demonstrate my line of reasoning of late.</p>

<p><div> <a class="donate-with-crypto" href="https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/40266c65-e420-4740-9c52-ddd24cca633c"> <span>Donate to the Honor Jar</span> </a> <script src="https://commerce.coinbase.com/v1/checkout.js"></script></div><br /></p>

<p>You can see that it goes to <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://commerce.coinbase.com">new commerce system</a> that they are building, which I feel is really neat, and is again the reason I share it here.  This all got me to explore a lot in the past few weeks especially and I wanted to get my thoughts out in the open here.</p>

<h3 id="option-1-donations">Option #1: Donations</h3>

<p>I have already summarized this.  I could accept donations, but this is a form of handout that I am not comfortable with doing.  Not only does it set you up to fail (in my opinion), but you really only get one of these.  I would rather do this if I had like no food in the fridge and electricity company is knocking on the door (or worse).</p>

<h3 id="option-2-donations-in-exchange-for-something-at-a-later-date">Option #2: Donations in Exchange for Something at a Later Date</h3>

<p>This is actually what I ended up exploring with my &ldquo;Honor Jar&rdquo;: donate and you get something of value that can be sold at a later date.  The problem is that this &ldquo;something of value&rdquo; is my art, and while I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)">certainly in love with myself</a>, it&rsquo;s a bit pretentious to think that my art is worthy of something to essentially invest in for later value.</p>

<h3 id="option-3-ico">Option #3: ICO</h3>

<p><em>Wandering into dangerous territory here</em>.  In studying cryptocurrency, ICOs are a rampant phenomenon right now.  In fact, if you wanted to, you could <a href="https://medium.com/bitfwd/how-to-do-an-ico-on-ethereum-in-less-than-20-minutes-a0062219374">spend 20 minutes and create one yourself</a>.  However, this again gets back to the aforementioned problems.  You not only attract a lot of attention to yourself, but you establish expectations, which as anyone who has experience with human beings can tell you, is a Bad Thingâ„¢.</p>

<p>Also, having been part of a startup as I mention in <a href="https://superdotnet.run/#who-are-you">Super.NET&rsquo;s introduction</a>, I have had enough of that &ldquo;environment&rdquo; to last me for a while, if not a lifetime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="https://youtu.be/TJh5wdvdfVE">Lester Burnham</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear in all my decisions here that striving for the least amount of responsibility is the best chance for success on any level.</p>

<h3 id="option-4-take-time-to-study-the-space">Option #4: Take Time to Study the Space</h3>

<p>This is sort of where I am at now.  Even though I am essentially working off savings and full-time towards this endeavor, I am not strapped for cash at the moment.  I have about a year to put together a proof-of-concept that explores my ideas and gauge market traction.  There&rsquo;s a lot to explore here.  Cryptocurrency, blockchains, sidechains, oh my.</p>

<h3 id="option-5-create-a-proof-of-concept-with-revenue-model">Option #5: Create a Proof-of-Concept with Revenue Model</h3>

<p>This option paired with the previous option shows promise.  What I like about this is that I show a working model that generates revenue without having to ask anyone for money.  However, the problem now is that I am essentially building two applications: Super.NET (the framework and foundation), and then the proof-of-concept which is the application that is build upon Super.NET.  Super.NET is easily a year or more endeavor by itself.  In fact I would say it is 2-3 years full time with a very small team.</p>

<h3 id="option-6-bite-the-bullet-and-create-a-javascript-application">Option #6: Bite the Bullet and Create a JavaScript Application</h3>

<p>It sucks to think about doing this.  This is actually a violation of my principles and is the reason why I am doing Super.NET after all.  But after thinking about this, this is truly the only way to get to what I want accomplished without asking for money from others.  Additionally, much like my foray with Hugo, there might be some elements in the world of JavaScript development that I might be able to pull back with me in my pursuit of Super.NET.</p>

<h2 id="selecting-the-path-forward">Selecting the Path Forward</h2>

<p>So what have I landed on?  Basically options 4-6 as listed above.</p>

<p>The point here is to build a proof-of-concept that simply demonstrates the business model I have in mind.  It will be ugly as sin but get the job done.  Ugly as sin to win, yo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ugly as sin to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that my roots are in JavaScript and HTML, so it&rsquo;s not a matter of skill, but desire (ðŸ˜‚).  The idea will be to get a proof-of-concept that shows the big ideas, on a site that basically is built from Visual Studio&rsquo;s React+Redux templates and nothing more.</p>

<p>From there, it&rsquo;s onto the proof-of-concept.  Once the proof-of-concept is done (in JavaScript/HTML5), and there is interest in the idea, the idea is to move towards a world where I can work on Super.NET full-time while building out the next version of this proof-of-concept application.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking perhaps 3-4 months to build what I have in mind.  Let&rsquo;s see how I do. ðŸ˜‰</p>
