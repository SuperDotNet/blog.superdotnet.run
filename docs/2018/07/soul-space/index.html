<p>This is an article on the topic of <a href="/2018/07/philosophy">philosophy in software, business, and life</a>.</p>

<h2 id="quick-word-on-value-judgments">Quick Word on Value Judgments</h2>

<p>Before diving into the subject, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to have a quick word on what might be perceived as value judgements within my communication.  That is, in describing my approach, the tendency is to say or perhaps infer that my suggestions or suggested approach is &ldquo;better than&rdquo; or &ldquo;above&rdquo; another.  This is not my intent these days, but I will say that was certainly my state of mind at one point in my younger years.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that there are a <em>multitude</em> of ways to approach a problem.  You have to learn what works best for you and you alone, all the while making sure that it&rsquo;s <em>your</em> path.</p>

<p>Having your own voice is key here, one that is free to express itself without limits <em>so that it is truly authentic</em>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s also important is that we <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#respect-every-opinion">respect other opinions and approaches</a>, even if and when that opinion differs from your own.  Be receptive to feedback and change.  This was an especially difficult lesson for me, especially after Silverlight was discontinued (which I address in <a href="/2018/07/aspire-to-inspire/">the next article</a>).</p>

<h2 id="soul-space">Soul Space</h2>

<p>What is &ldquo;soul space?&rdquo;  Well, the way I look at it &ndash; we are talking philosophy here, after all: we are all here on this planet to &ldquo;carve out our own soul&rdquo; in this realm that we currently find ourselves in presently.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a &ldquo;soul space&rdquo; for lack of a better expression: a space to carve out our souls.</p>

<p>If you have seen the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_(film)">Big</a>, then you might remember the scene where the protagonist as a kid ventures into a carnival <a href="https://youtu.be/FQ0sHPD5JMg">and stumbles upon a fortune teller</a> &ndash; Zoltar! &ndash; that offers a &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; (or granted wish) that results in the plot for the movie: the kid abruptly turns into an adult and learns how to live as one as such.</p>

<p>Well, this metaphor is the closest that I can describe the realm we find ourselves in now.  I would like to think that we somehow entered this realm in some fashion much like being in some sort of carnival or even arcade of sorts on some plane that is completely indescribable to our present way of being.  In doing so, this &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; is essentially used to script out our &ldquo;human soul&rdquo; here in this grand theatre called Earth.</p>

<p>What I would like to think is that you are now this alien conglomeration visiting this realm, visiting this place and <em>etching out your soul</em> accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented-parts-of-a-composite-whole">Fragmented Parts of a Composite Whole</h2>

<p>Of course, you are not the only here in this theatre, <em>but others are as well</em>.</p>

<p>However,  herein lies a key component to what I believe, and I will get into why this matters in business and software after diving into this rabbit hole.</p>

<p>We perceive others as being separate, but consider that the planet we find ourselves on now very well could be an <em>organism</em> in its own right, and that we each as a human being are comprised of this organism.  As such, you and I as a human being are actually cells of this seven-billion celled organism called Earth.</p>

<p>We all <em>seem</em> autonomous, but are we <em>really</em>?  Are we really so separate?  Could it be that the same life force is cycling and oscillating between these seven billion &ldquo;cells&rdquo; every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time">Planck second</a>?  Or perhaps even faster as such?</p>

<p>Consider that we live in a realm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance">where dots of space can instantly share information with each other no matter the distance</a>.  We currently have no grasp or full understanding &ndash; nor are we anywhere near close to it &ndash; on these &ldquo;dots of space&rdquo; within our own brains and what information they are sharing with other &ldquo;places&rdquo; within the Universe (or elsewhere) which could, in fact, <em>be other human brains</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-business">What Does This Have to Do with Business?</h2>

<p>Rounding back to the important point here and <a href="/2018/07/philosophy/">one relevant to software</a>, is that if we are all connected in this way, we should also put this into perspective <em>when we relate to each other</em>.  More specifically, we should be mindful for <a href="https://blog.superdotnet.run/2018/06/hello-world-welcome-to-super.net-blog-dawg/#choose-your-energy-carefully">when we treat each other with negative energy</a>.  Even further, consider that when you denigrate or cast down aspersions upon another human being or &ldquo;fellow cell,&rdquo; you are actually doing it to a part of your greater self, which, for all intents and purposes of the reasoning here, <strong><em>is actually you</em></strong> but in a different configuration of reality.</p>

<p>As I hope to highlight further in this series on philosophy, Super.NET is not about making a quick buck or looking to achieve &ldquo;<a href="/2018/06/who-is-agent-smith/">nerd popularity</a>,&rdquo; but more about ensuring that we <a href="https://youtu.be/uqI9gvZMOGo">do the right thing</a> and establish a <em>legacy</em> &ndash; that of <em>enduring .NET excellence</em>.  Not just in the software we build, but also in <em>how we treat each other in doing so</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are not wrong answers here, only decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, if others are themselves carving out their own soul in the same manner that I am, then <em>who am I to judge them</em>?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf5nCPFBSHw">Who am I</a> to state that their soul &ndash; or rather, <em>their decisions</em> in carving out their design as such &ndash; is better or worse than mine?  This is a big epiphany of mine lately and thought I would share it here, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>There are not wrong answers here, only decisions.</p>
