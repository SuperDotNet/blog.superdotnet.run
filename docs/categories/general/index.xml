Unless of course you don&amp;#8217;t care about them, then you haven&amp;#8217;t noticed them at all. üôÇ These of course were a side project of mine based on the Xaml-console based application that ran on a weekly basis, tallying the latest vote totals from numerous Microsoft UserVoice forums.</description>

In fact, I have been so concerned with¬†it that I have created a vote to change this very issue¬†along with¬†other latent misgivings in the Visual Studio project system.</description>
